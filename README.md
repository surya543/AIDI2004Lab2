# Code Description:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded from the provided URL using pandas.
Unnecessary columns, such as the 'id' column, are dropped.
The target variable ('diagnosis') and features are separated.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The distribution of the target variable is visualized using matplotlib, showing the counts of malignant and benign diagnoses.
Model Selection:

A Random Forest classifier is chosen for building the machine learning model due to its robustness and effectiveness in handling complex datasets.
Model Training:

The Random Forest classifier is trained on the training data using the fit() method.
Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the testing data using the trained model.
Classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class
